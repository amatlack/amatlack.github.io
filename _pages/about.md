Allison Matlack is currently the Head of Engineering Culture & Programs at [Block](https://block.xyz/), where she ensures that teams, work, and culture thrive within an ecosystem of nearly 5,000 engineers creating tools to expand economic access.

Before joining Block, Allison was the Technical Business Operations Manager at [GitHub](https://github.com/about), the world's largest software development platform. At GitHub, she focused on internal communications, culture, and change management for the engineering organization, playing a key role in shaping [organizational communications strategies](https://github.blog/2023-10-04-how-to-communicate-like-a-github-engineer-our-principles-practices-and-tools/), enhancing organizational health, and supporting engineers and engineering managers.

Allison spent nearly 12 years at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/about), most recently as lead of the global Products and Technologies Communications team. There, she played a pivotal role in internal communications and change management during the Red Hat / IBM acquisition, and later established the company's first executive communications team. In addition to creating the pilot that grew into the company's global mentoring program, the accomplishment Allison is most proud of from her tenure at Red Hat is following through on six years of persistent effort to allow for updating of name-based kerberos IDs in support of diversity and inclusion programs, requiring collaboration with stakeholders across multiple organizations and 200+ impacted applications.

[Described by peers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amatlack/) as "the powerhouse and heart of an organization," Allison is a vocal advocate for open decision-making, transparent communications, and [empowerment](/understanding-engagement-empowerment). She has served as an [Open Organization Ambassador](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/ambassadors-program) since 2016, promoting the collaborative principles of open source software development in various contexts. 

Allison holds an M.A. from West Virginia University in Professional Writing and Editing. Her thesis, [Rhetorical Bridges: How Rhetoric Affects the Gap Between Knowledge and Behavior Change](https://researchrepository.wvu.edu/etd/864/), was inspired by her service as a Peace Corps Volunteer and proposes an interactive health communication website that illustrates how rhetoric can bridge the gap between knowledge and behavior change.
